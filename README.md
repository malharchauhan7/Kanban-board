# Kanban Board
A Kanban board is a visual tool that helps teams manage projects by organizing work into columns and cards. The word "Kanban" is Japanese for "visual signal". 

## How it works 
- Columns: Represent activities in a workflow, such as "to do", "in progress", and "done"
- Cards: Represent tasks that move through the workflow
- Work-in-progress (WIP) limits: Set the maximum number of tasks that can be in a column at any given time
- Swimlanes: Categorize issues by criteria like user or issue type

## Benefits 
- Helps teams visualize their work
- Helps teams identify bottlenecks and improve workflow
- Helps teams maintain a steady flow of work
- Helps teams commit to the right amount of work
